# Changelog - Developer Profiles

All notable changes to developer profiles will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

**⚠️ CRITICAL - MANDATORY DEVELOPER TRACKING**:

- **Cursor/AI entries**: `[Cursor]` - e.g., `[Cursor]`
- **Format**: `- Description of change [Developer: Name]` or `- Description of change [Cursor]`
- **Purpose**: Accountability, tracking, audit trail, and responsibility assignment
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - All entries must include developer/Cursor tracking
- **This is MANDATORY and STRICTLY ENFORCED**
