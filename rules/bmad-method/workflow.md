# BMAD-METHOD Workflow Rules

**Source**: `instructions/BMAD-METHOD/`

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD provides structured, battle-tested workflows powered by specialized agents who understand agile development.

## Core Workflow Principles

### Scale-Adaptive Intelligence
- Automatically adjusts planning depth from **bug fixes to enterprise systems**
- Workflows adapt to project complexity
- No over-engineering for simple tasks
- Comprehensive planning for complex systems

### Complete Development Lifecycle
1. **Analysis** - Understand requirements and context
2. **Planning** - Create structured plans and tasks
3. **Architecture** - Design system architecture
4. **Implementation** - Build and test features

### Specialized Agent Expertise
- **19 specialized agents** with specific roles:
  - Product Manager
  - Architect
  - Developer
  - UX Designer
  - QA Engineer
  - And more...

## Workflow Types

### Greenfield Projects
- Start from scratch
- Full planning and architecture
- Complete workflow from analysis to implementation

### Brownfield Projects
- Work with existing codebase
- Adapt workflows to existing structure
- Incremental improvements and features

### Bug Fixes
- Quick, focused workflows
- Minimal planning overhead
- Direct to implementation

## Agent Collaboration

### Agent Roles
- Each agent has **deep domain expertise**
- Agents work together seamlessly
- Specialized knowledge for each phase

### Workflow Execution
- Follow structured workflows
- Use appropriate agents for each task
- Maintain context across workflow phases

## Best Practices

### Workflow Selection
- Choose workflow appropriate to task complexity
- Use scale-adaptive intelligence
- Don't over-plan simple tasks
- Don't under-plan complex systems

### Agent Usage
- Use specialized agents for their expertise
- Follow agent recommendations
- Maintain workflow context

### Documentation
- Document workflow decisions
- Track agent recommendations
- Maintain project context

## CRITICAL Rules

- ✅ **Use scale-adaptive workflows** - Match complexity to task
- ✅ **Follow complete lifecycle** - Analysis → Planning → Architecture → Implementation
- ✅ **Use specialized agents** - Leverage agent expertise
- ✅ **Maintain workflow context** - Keep information flowing
- ✅ **Document decisions** - Track workflow choices
- ❌ **Don't over-plan** simple tasks
- ❌ **Don't under-plan** complex systems
- ❌ **Don't skip workflow phases** without justification
- ❌ **Don't ignore agent recommendations** without reason
