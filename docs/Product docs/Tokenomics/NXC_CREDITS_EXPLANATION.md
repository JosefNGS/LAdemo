## What Are NXC Credits?

**NXC Credits** (Nexus Credits) are the native utility tokens of the BitNexus platform. They serve as the primary currency for platform interactions, AI-powered features, and access to premium services.

### Key Characteristics

- **Utility Token**: Used for platform operations, not a speculative investment
- **Dual Purpose**: Network interactions + AI usage credits
- **Non-Transferable**: Credits are account-bound (in current implementation)
- **Purchasable**: Available in packages from the Credits Shop
- **Earnable**: Can be earned through platform activities

### Current Exchange Rate

- **1 NXC Credit ≈ $3.00 USD** (market-driven, adjusts based on demand)

---

## Two Types of Credits

NXC Credits serve two distinct purposes within the BitNexus ecosystem:

### 1. Network Credits (Base NXC)

**Purpose**: Platform interactions and network operations

**Used For**:
- Product listing fees (25 NXC per product submission)
- Platform transaction fees
- Premium feature access
- Staking in MEV Bot and XAB Bot (XRP) for passive income
- Network rewards and bonuses

**How It Works**:
- When you purchase an NXC package, you receive base NXC credits
- These credits are used for general platform operations
- Can be staked in bots to earn 10-15% APY passive income

### 2. AI Credits (Included Bonus)

**Purpose**: Power AI-powered features across the platform

**Used For**:
- **Content Generator**: 10 NXC credits per content generation
- **NexusHub AI**: AI assistant interactions (future implementation)
- **AI Recommendations**: Smart product suggestions (future implementation)
- **AI Analytics**: Advanced performance insights (future implementation)

**How It Works**:
- Each NXC package includes bonus AI credits
- AI credits are separate from network credits
- Dedicated specifically to AI feature usage
- Cannot be used for network operations

**Example**:
- Purchase 100 NXC Growth Pack → Receive 100 Network Credits + 50 AI Credits
- Use 10 AI Credits to generate content in Content Generator
- Remaining: 100 Network Credits + 40 AI Credits
