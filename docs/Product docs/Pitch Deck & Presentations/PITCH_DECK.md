## Slide 2: The Problem

### **The Old Economy is Broken**

**Three Critical Pain Points**:

1. **Platform Exploitation**
   - Centralized platforms take 30-50% of earnings
   - Hidden fees and restrictive terms
   - Users work harder, earn less

2. **Manual Labor Trap**
   - Hours spent on content creation
   - Manual link sharing and tracking
   - No automation for network building

3. **Trust Deficit**
   - Opaque commission structures
   - No transparency in earnings
   - Platform can change rules anytime

**The Result**: 
> "People are working 60-hour weeks in affiliate marketing and still struggling to reach $1,000/month passive income."
