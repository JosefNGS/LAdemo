## Overview

This document provides a template for a Letter of Intent (LOI) for client engagements. The LOI is typically a non-binding document that outlines the proposed terms of a client relationship before entering into a formal Master Services Agreement (MSA).

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This is a template only. Actual LOIs must be created with legal counsel and tailored to specific client engagements. LOIs are typically non-binding but may contain binding provisions (e.g., exclusivity, confidentiality).
