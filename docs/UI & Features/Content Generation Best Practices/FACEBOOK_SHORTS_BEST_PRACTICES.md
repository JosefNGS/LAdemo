## Overview

Facebook Shorts are vertical videos (up to 60 seconds) designed to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. This document outlines best practices for generating Facebook Shorts-optimized content using the BitNexus Content Generator.

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Hook in First 3 Seconds
- **CRITICAL**: Capture attention immediately
- Use relatable scenarios or questions
- Show the value or outcome upfront
- Example hooks:
  - "If you're struggling with [problem], watch this..."
  - "This one tip changed my [outcome]..."
  - "Most people don't know this about..."

### 2. Vertical Format (9:16 Aspect Ratio)
- **Required**: 1080x1920 pixels (portrait orientation)
- Optimized for mobile viewing
- Text must be readable without zooming
- Consider Facebook's UI overlay (avoid bottom area)

### 3. Optimal Length
- **15-30 seconds**: Best for engagement
- **30-60 seconds**: For detailed tutorials or stories
- **Note**: Facebook favors shorter content (15-30 seconds)

### 4. Native Content
- Upload directly to Facebook (not cross-posted)
- Facebook algorithm favors native uploads
- Use Facebook's video tools and features

## Content Structure
