TikTok shorts are vertical videos optimized for mobile viewing, typically 15-60 seconds in length. This document outlines best practices for generating TikTok-optimized content using the BitNexus Content Generator.

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Hook in First 3 Seconds
- **CRITICAL**: Capture attention immediately
- Start with a question, bold statement, or visual surprise
- Show the value/outcome in the first frame
- Example hooks:
  - "This one mistake cost me $10,000..."
  - "I made $5K in one week doing this..."
  - "Stop doing this if you want to succeed..."

### 2. Vertical Format (9:16 Aspect Ratio)
- **Required**: 1080x1920 pixels (portrait orientation)
- Full-screen mobile experience
- Text and graphics must be readable in vertical format
- Avoid horizontal content that requires rotation

### 3. Optimal Length
- **15-30 seconds**: Highest engagement for product promotions
- **30-60 seconds**: For educational content or tutorials
- **Under 15 seconds**: Quick tips or teasers
- **Avoid**: Videos over 60 seconds (unless part of a series)

### 4. Fast-Paced Editing
- Quick cuts every 2-4 seconds
- Dynamic transitions
- No dead air or long pauses
- Keep energy high throughout

## Content Structure

### Opening (0-3 seconds)
- Hook that stops the scroll
- Visual that matches the hook
- Clear value proposition

### Body (3-25 seconds)
- Deliver on the hook's promise
- Show, don't just tell
- Use text overlays for key points
- Include product visuals if promoting

### Closing (25-30 seconds)
- Clear call-to-action (CTA)
- Link in bio mention
- Follow/subscribe prompt
- Next video teaser

## Text Overlay Best Practices

### Readability
- **Font Size**: Large, bold fonts (minimum 48pt)
- **Contrast**: White text with dark outline or vice versa
- **Position**: Center or upper third of screen
- **Duration**: 2-3 seconds per text card
- **Limit**: 1-2 lines of text per overlay

### Content Tips
- Use numbers and statistics
- Ask questions to engage
- Include emojis sparingly (1-2 max)
- Use trending phrases when relevant

---

## Audio Best Practices

### Music Selection
- Use trending sounds when possible
- Match music tempo to video energy
- Ensure music doesn't overpower voiceover
- Consider original audio for brand consistency

### Voiceover Guidelines
- Clear, energetic delivery
- Speak at 1.2x-1.5x normal speed
- Use natural pauses for emphasis
- Avoid monotone delivery

## Hashtag Strategy

### Hashtag Mix
- **1-2 Broad Hashtags**: #crypto #trading #affiliate
- **2-3 Niche Hashtags**: #cryptotrading #affiliatemarketing
- **1-2 Trending Hashtags**: Check TikTok trends daily
- **1 Brand Hashtag**: #BitNexus or custom brand tag

### Best Practices
- Use 3-5 hashtags total (TikTok algorithm prefers fewer)
- Mix popular (1M+ views) and niche (10K-100K views)
- Update hashtags based on current trends
- Test different combinations

## Engagement Tactics

### Comments & Interaction
