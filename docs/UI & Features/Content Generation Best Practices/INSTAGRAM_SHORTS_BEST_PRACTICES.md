## Overview

Instagram Reels are short-form vertical videos (up to 90 seconds) designed to compete with TikTok. This document outlines best practices for generating Instagram Reels-optimized content using the BitNexus Content Generator.

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Hook in First 3 Seconds
- **CRITICAL**: Capture attention immediately
- Use trending audio or visual hook
- Show the outcome or transformation
- Ask a compelling question
- Example hooks:
  - "POV: You just discovered this..."
  - "This changed everything for me..."
  - "Stop scrolling if you want to..."

### 2. Vertical Format (9:16 Aspect Ratio)
- **Required**: 1080x1920 pixels (portrait orientation)
- Optimized for mobile viewing
- Text must be readable without zooming
- Consider Instagram's UI overlay (avoid bottom 150px for text)

### 3. Optimal Length
- **15-30 seconds**: Best for engagement and reach
- **30-60 seconds**: For tutorials or detailed content
- **60-90 seconds**: For storytelling or educational content
- **Note**: Instagram favors 15-30 second Reels in algorithm

### 4. Trending Audio
- Use trending sounds from Instagram's audio library
- Original audio can perform well if unique
- Match audio mood to content tone
- Audio is discoverable (users can find your Reel via audio)
