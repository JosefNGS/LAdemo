# Development Documentation Changelog

All notable changes to development documentation will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**⚠️ CRITICAL - MANDATORY DEVELOPER TRACKING**:
Every changelog entry MUST track who made the change:
- **Developer entries**: `[Developer: Full Name]` - e.g., `[Developer: Josef Lindbom]`, `[Developer: Craig Martin]`, `[Developer: Jonne Waselius]`, `[Developer: Cory]`
- **Cursor/AI entries**: `[Cursor]` - e.g., `[Cursor]`
- **Format**: `- Description of change [Developer: Full Name]` or `- Description of change [Cursor]`
- **Purpose**: Accountability, tracking, audit trail, and responsibility assignment
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - All entries must include developer/Cursor tracking
- **This is MANDATORY and STRICTLY ENFORCED**
