# Product Mission (Lite) - WHN Chat

**WHN Chat (Why Not Chat)** is a modern AI chat application that helps developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts interact with local and cloud AI models by providing a fast, privacy-focused, multi-provider chat interface with persistent sessions and intelligent knowledge base management.

WHN Chat serves developers, researchers, and privacy-conscious users who need a unified interface for multiple AI providers with complete data control. Unlike cloud-based AI services, WHN Chat provides local-first architecture with file-based storage, support for fully local AI models via Ollama, and Docker-based vector database integration. The application features advanced session management, knowledge base with fuzzy search, configurable conversation memory, and cross-platform desktop/web versions with one-click deployment.
